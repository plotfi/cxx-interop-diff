 * @discussion
 * When not building with Objective-C ARC, a block object allocated on or
 * copied to the heap must be released with a -[release] message or the
 * Block_release() function.
 *
 * The declaration of a block literal allocates storage on the stack.
 * Therefore, this is an invalid construct:
 * <code>
 * dispatch_block_t block;
 * if (x) {
 *     block = ^{ printf("true\n"); };
 * } else {
 *     block = ^{ printf("false\n"); };

 *     block = &__tmp_1;
 * } else {
 *     struct Block __tmp_2 = ...; // setup details
 *     block = &__tmp_2;
 * }
 * </code>
 *
 * As the example demonstrates, the address of a stack variable is escaping the
 * scope in which it is allocated. That is a classic C bug.
 *
 * Instead, the block literal must be copied to the heap with the Block_copy()
 * function or by sending it a -[copy] message.

   *
   * @discussion
   * An object's target queue is responsible for processing the object.
   *
   * When no quality of service class and relative priority is specified for a
   * dispatch queue at the time of creation, a dispatch queue's quality of service
   * class is inherited from its target queue. The dispatch_get_global_queue()
   * function may be used to obtain a target queue of a specific quality of
   * service class, however the use of dispatch_queue_attr_make_with_qos_class()
   * is recommended instead.
   *
   * Blocks submitted to a serial queue whose target queue is another serial
   * queue will not be invoked concurrently with blocks submitted to the target
   * queue or to any other queue with that same target queue.
   *
   * The result of introducing a cycle into the hierarchy of target queues is
   * undefined.
   *
   * A dispatch source's target queue specifies where its event handler and
   * cancellation handler blocks will be submitted.
   *
   * A dispatch I/O channel's target queue specifies where where its I/O
   * operations are executed. If the channel's target queue's priority is set to
   * DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_BACKGROUND, then the I/O operations performed by
   * dispatch_io_read() or dispatch_io_write() on that queue will be
   * throttled when there is I/O contention.
   *
   * For all other dispatch object types, the only function of the target queue
   * is to determine where an object's finalizer function is invoked.
   *
   * In general, changing the target queue of an object is an asynchronous
   * operation that doesn't take effect immediately, and doesn't affect blocks
   * already associated with the specified object.
   *
   * However, if an object is inactive at the time dispatch_set_target_queue() is
   * called, then the target queue change takes effect immediately, and will
   * affect blocks already associated with the specified object. After an
   * initially inactive object has been activated, calling
   * dispatch_set_target_queue() results in an assertion and the process being
   * terminated.
   *
   * If a dispatch queue is active and targeted by other dispatch objects,
   * changing its target queue results in undefined behavior.  Instead, it is
   * recommended to create dispatch objects in an inactive state, set up the
   * relevant target queues and then activate them.
   *
   * @param object
   * The object to modify.
   * The result of passing NULL in this parameter is undefined.
   *
   * @param queue
   * The new target queue for the object. The queue is retained, and the

 * @function dispatch_queue_attr_make_with_qos_class
 *
 * @abstract
 * Returns an attribute value which may be provided to dispatch_queue_create()
 * or dispatch_queue_create_with_target(), in order to assign a QOS class and
 * relative priority to the queue.
 *
 * @discussion
 * When specified in this manner, the QOS class and relative priority take
 * precedence over those inherited from the dispatch queue's target queue (if
 * any) as long that does not result in a lower QOS class and relative priority.
 *
 * The global queue priorities map to the following QOS classes:
 *  - DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH:         QOS_CLASS_USER_INITIATED
 *  - DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT:      QOS_CLASS_DEFAULT
 *  - DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_LOW:          QOS_CLASS_UTILITY
 *  - DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_BACKGROUND:   QOS_CLASS_BACKGROUND
 *
 * Example:
 * <code>
 *	dispatch_queue_t queue;
 *	dispatch_queue_attr_t attr;
 *	attr = dispatch_queue_attr_make_with_qos_class(DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL,
 *			QOS_CLASS_UTILITY, 0);
 *	queue = dispatch_queue_create("com.example.myqueue", attr);
 * </code>
 *
 * The QOS class and relative priority set this way on a queue have no effect on
 * blocks that are submitted synchronously to a queue (via dispatch_sync(),
 * dispatch_barrier_sync()).
 *
 * @param attr
 * A queue attribute value to be combined with the QOS class, or NULL.
 *
 * @param qos_class
 * A QOS class value:
 *  - QOS_CLASS_USER_INTERACTIVE
 *  - QOS_CLASS_USER_INITIATED
 *  - QOS_CLASS_DEFAULT
 *  - QOS_CLASS_UTILITY
 *  - QOS_CLASS_BACKGROUND
 * Passing any other value results in NULL being returned.
 *
 * @param relative_priority
 * A relative priority within the QOS class. This value is a negative
 * offset from the maximum supported scheduler priority for the given class.
 * Passing a value greater than zero or less than QOS_MIN_RELATIVE_PRIORITY
 * results in NULL being returned.
 *
 * @return
 * Returns an attribute value which may be provided to dispatch_queue_create()
 * and dispatch_queue_create_with_target(), or NULL if an invalid QOS class was
 * requested.
 * The new value combines the attributes specified by the 'attr' parameter and

 * @discussion
 * An object's target queue is responsible for processing the object.
 *
 * When no quality of service class and relative priority is specified for a
 * dispatch queue at the time of creation, a dispatch queue's quality of service
 * class is inherited from its target queue. The dispatch_get_global_queue()
 * function may be used to obtain a target queue of a specific quality of
 * service class, however the use of dispatch_queue_attr_make_with_qos_class()
 * is recommended instead.
 *
 * Blocks submitted to a serial queue whose target queue is another serial
 * queue will not be invoked concurrently with blocks submitted to the target
 * queue or to any other queue with that same target queue.
 *
 * The result of introducing a cycle into the hierarchy of target queues is
 * undefined.
 *
 * A dispatch source's target queue specifies where its event handler and
 * cancellation handler blocks will be submitted.
 *
 * A dispatch I/O channel's target queue specifies where where its I/O
 * operations are executed. If the channel's target queue's priority is set to
 * DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_BACKGROUND, then the I/O operations performed by
 * dispatch_io_read() or dispatch_io_write() on that queue will be
 * throttled when there is I/O contention.
 *
 * For all other dispatch object types, the only function of the target queue
 * is to determine where an object's finalizer function is invoked.
 *
 * In general, changing the target queue of an object is an asynchronous
 * operation that doesn't take effect immediately, and doesn't affect blocks
 * already associated with the specified object.
 *
 * However, if an object is inactive at the time dispatch_set_target_queue() is
 * called, then the target queue change takes effect immediately, and will
 * affect blocks already associated with the specified object. After an
 * initially inactive object has been activated, calling
 * dispatch_set_target_queue() results in an assertion and the process being
 * terminated.
 *
 * If a dispatch queue is active and targeted by other dispatch objects,
 * changing its target queue results in undefined behavior.  Instead, it is

 * block, the QOS class assigned to the queue and which of the following flags
 * was specified or defaulted to:
 *  - DISPATCH_BLOCK_INHERIT_QOS_CLASS: default for asynchronous execution
 *  - DISPATCH_BLOCK_ENFORCE_QOS_CLASS: default for synchronous execution
 * See description of dispatch_block_flags_t for details.
 *
 * If the returned dispatch block object is submitted directly to a serial queue
 * and is configured to execute with a specific QOS class, the system will make
 * a best effort to apply the necessary QOS overrides to ensure that blocks
 * submitted earlier to the serial queue are executed at that same QOS class or
 * higher.
 *
 * @param flags
 * Configuration flags for the new block object.
 * Passing a value that is not a bitwise OR of flags from dispatch_block_flags_t
 * results in NULL being returned.
 *
 * @param qos_class
 * A QOS class value:
 *  - QOS_CLASS_USER_INTERACTIVE
 *  - QOS_CLASS_USER_INITIATED
 *  - QOS_CLASS_DEFAULT
 *  - QOS_CLASS_UTILITY
 *  - QOS_CLASS_BACKGROUND
 *  - QOS_CLASS_UNSPECIFIED
 * Passing QOS_CLASS_UNSPECIFIED is equivalent to specifying the
 * DISPATCH_BLOCK_NO_QOS_CLASS flag. Passing any other value results in NULL
 * being returned.
 *
 * @param relative_priority
 * A relative priority within the QOS class. This value is a negative
 * offset from the maximum supported scheduler priority for the given class.
 * Passing a value greater than zero or less than QOS_MIN_RELATIVE_PRIORITY
 * results in NULL being returned.
 *
 * @param block
 * The block to create the dispatch block object from.
 *
 * @result
 * The newly created dispatch block object, or NULL.
 * When not building with Objective-C ARC, must be released with a -[release]
 * message or the Block_release() function.

/**
 * @function dispatch_source_create
 *
 * @abstract
 * Creates a new dispatch source to monitor low-level system objects and auto-
 * matically submit a handler block to a dispatch queue in response to events.
 *
 * @discussion
 * Dispatch sources are not reentrant. Any events received while the dispatch
 * source is suspended or while the event handler block is currently executing
 * will be coalesced and delivered after the dispatch source is resumed or the
 * event handler block has returned.
 *
 * Dispatch sources are created in an inactive state. After creating the
 * source and setting any desired attributes (i.e. the handler, context, etc.),
 * a call must be made to dispatch_activate() in order to begin event delivery.
 *
 * Calling dispatch_set_target_queue() on a source once it has been activated
 * is not allowed (see dispatch_activate() and dispatch_set_target_queue()).
 *
 * For backward compatibility reasons, dispatch_resume() on an inactive,
 * and not otherwise suspended source has the same effect as calling
 * dispatch_activate(). For new code, using dispatch_activate() is preferred.
 *
 * @param type
 * Declares the type of the dispatch source. Must be one of the defined
 * dispatch_source_type_t constants.

 * @param handle
 * The underlying system handle to monitor. The interpretation of this argument
 * is determined by the constant provided in the type parameter.
